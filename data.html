                                The YWI offers a snapshot of overall youth well-being by looking across indicators of health, education, 
                                positive social relationships, and community engagement. We also break down YWI analyses by sex and race/ethnicity.

                                    The index uses three main data sources: the U.S. Census Bureau, the California Department of Education (CDE), 
                                    and the California Healthy Kids Survey (CHKS). Each provides presents limitations (potential weaknesses) 
                                    that are important to understand when using the YWI because they might bias location scores.

                                    The U.S. Census Bureau provides extensive data on youth and family conditions throughout the United States. 
                                    Here we use American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year estimates for 2007-2012. Data limitations include:

                                    The CDE provides data on California students and schools. There are several challenges with the data used here. 
                                        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                                            <li>Teachers receive limited instruction on administering physical fitness tests, 
                                                which might lead to variability in the testing and results.</li>
                                            <li>The practice of sending some students to alternative schools run by county offices of education, 
                                                enrollment in charter, private and virtual schools (some of which enroll out-of-area students), 
                                                and home schooling affect the accuracy of dropout rates for district geographic areas; these schools’ 
                                                data, along with that of incarcerated students are not reflected in district-level data. School district 
                                                boundary changes complicate accurate data mapping.</li>

                                    <h4 class="expand-heading">3. CHKS</h4> 
                                    <div class="collapsable">
                                    The <a href="https://chks.wested.org" target="_blank">CHKS</a> was administered by CDE and WestEd to 5th, 7th, 
                                        9th and 11th grade students in most California school districts until 2011 (see [website] for more info on 
                                        administration)—here we use 9th and 11th grade data. CHKS offers rich information about students' experiences, 
                                        and it is the only large-scale California youth survey that aims to represent well (or “be representative” for) 
                                        geographic areas smaller than the county. Important dataset limitations to keep in mind are:
                                        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                                            <li>The survey typically is not administered at charter schools, alternative or community day 
                                                schools, home school programs, private schools, and schools serving incarcerated youth. 
                                                This could bias well-being scores. Data are missing altogether for some districts, in other 
                                                cases for a grade level, and in all cases for youth not attending school;</li>
                                            <li>School district boundary changes complicate accurate data mapping;</li>
                                            <li>Districts do not always meet the sampling and participation guidelines set by the 
                                                survey developers to produce sound (valid and representative) data. To have valid 
                                                and representative data, West Ed and CDE set these criteria.
                                                <ol type="1" style="font-size: 0.8em; margin-top: 3px;">
                                                    <li>100% of all district schools participated; or 100% of all selected schools participated in an approved sampling plan;</li>
                                                    <li>An appropriate class subject or class period was identified and used; </li>

                                        We are unable to assess whether districts met criteria 1-3. We do provide and use CHKS survey participation information. 
                                        For each map with CHKS data, an asterisk marks districts where CHKS participation rates were less than 60%. We provide 
                                        District CHKS Participation Rates in district pop-up boxes.  More information on student participation is available 
                                        in individual district secondary level reports, available at <a href="http://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/" target="_blank">http://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/</a>

                                        CHKS participation rates affect YWI map and data availability in two important ways:

                                    While the YWI covers some core elements of well-being, there are many important elements that we were unable to include 
                                    in this index (e.g. having positive relationships with parents and other family members, support to develop a strong

                                    For each of the four domains—health, education, social relationships, and community context—we assess the proportion 
                                    of youth in the most positive category across indicators. The overall index score is an average of the four domain scores.

                                    Original data elements came in multiple forms (e.g. Likert scales of varying size, percentages). We converted each 
                                    item to a percentage of the best possible score to standardize the measures. Results from correlational and principal 
                                    components analyses then informed indicator construction. We use a stepwise approach in which indicators are equally 
                                    weighted within each of the 4 domain scores, and then the domains are equally weighted in the overall index score.

                                    Some of our indicators make substantial use of CHKS data. To address the challenge of low participation rates in 
                                    some places (described further in the YWI Data Sources and Limitations Section), we made two choices about when 
                                    to calculate the YWI.

                                        <li>To address these data challenges we did not calculate the Youth Well-Being Index Score for districts where 
                                            CHKS participation rates were less than 40% and/or there were fewer than 15 participants who answered the survey

                                        The index lacks key indicators of well-being because data were unavailable, or unavailable at an appropriate 
                                        geographic unit. For example, it does not include robust measures of relationships with parents, peers, or 
                                        partners, which numerous studies find are pivotal factors in youth well-being. Nor does it include information 
                                        about positive gender, ethnic and sexual identity development. Indicator data for the education domain focuses 
                                        heavily on school and not at all on development of other critical life skills and knowledge (e.g. knowing 
                                        how to navigate systems, manage personal finances, etc.). The analysis is also constrained by the lack of 
                                        data on positive indicators of youth well-being (as opposed to measures of negative behaviors and outcomes).

                                        Indices are sensitive to the items included, how they are grouped, and how they are weighted in calculations 
                                        of summary scores. The 'stepwise equal weighting' method used here ultimately does create unequal weights 
                                        for indicators within domains due to differing numbers of indicators within a domain. Our main goals were 
                                        to equally weight each area, consistent with prior research, and to ensure that indicators provided the most 
                                        complete possible picture of well-being for each area. We used a method called “principal components analysis” 
                                        to help avoid significant redundancy in indicator grouping and measurement of effects.

                                        As with any index created by summing multiple items into a composite measure, the YWI is subject to the 
                                        problem of compensatability. In brief, this means that a high score in one area may offset a low score in 
                                        another, leading to a moderate overall score for an individual school district. Another school district may 
                                        achieve the same overall score through the combination of moderate sub-area scores. These two districts, 
                                        though qualitatively different, would appear similar on the map given their index scores. Similarly, two 
                                        districts could achieve the same domain score through different combinations of values on the component 
                                        indicators. The compensability problem therefore limits the ability of the index to convey how youth are 
                                        faring. To help with interpretation, in the pop-up boxes associated with each district we provide 
                                        information about the distribution of sub-scores whenever possible.

                                        use. However, a set of California Capital Region-focused qualitative studies of youth well-being (n(youth)=16, 
                                        n(adult allies)=59) offered one external basis for assessment of a pilot version of the index, and patterns

                                The YVI assesses vulnerability to inadequate support for well-being. It combines four types of data, 
                                which we call “indicators,”— the rates at which youth became teen mothers, did not complete high school, 
                                were placed in foster care, and lived in households with very low family incomes. The YVI and related 
                                indicator data and maps are available by census tract and county; sub-group analyses are provided by county.

                                Individual place-based indicator scores reflect comparison to a benchmark that could be considered 
                                excellent progress. For each indicator the benchmark is based on the rates experienced by 10% of all 
                                CA youth in the counties with the lowest rates. Each place receives a “score” for each indicator:

                                The YVI averages the four indicator scores for each county and census tract, and highlights places 
                                scoring relatively low (meaning lower vulnerability rates) and high (meaning higher vulnerability rates) 
                                across the four indicators.

                                identification as LGBTQ, and unauthorized immigration status. Unfortunately these data are either 
                                unavailable or unavailable for a geographic unit smaller than the county, so we are unable to include

                                <div class="collapsable">
                                    To develop benchmarks for each indicator, we adopted an approach employed in health care 
                                    research called “Achievable Benchmarks of Care,” or “ABC.” The basic idea is to rank order 
                                    all the counties in order of performance on the indicator, and select the 90th percentile 
                                    as the benchmark. This would set the benchmark at the level achieved by the county which 
                                    performs better than 90% of the other counties. However, this approach can give undue 
                                    influence to very small counties, which may not be very representative of the larger 
                                    population. The “ABC” approach limits the influence that small places can have on the 
                                    benchmark. The steps are as follows:
                                    <ol type="1">
                                    <li>First, calculate the performance for each county, adjusting county size to reduce 
                                        the impact of smaller units</li>
                                    <li>rank order the counties by their adjusted performance scores</li>
                                    <li>beginning with the best-performing county, sequentially add county population until 
                                        at least 10% of the total population is included in the sum</li>
                                    <li>calculate the performance for the subset of counties included in the sum by 
                                        aggregating the numerator and denominator counts.</li>

                                    Here is a worked example for teen birth rate, which assumes that the total population of 
                                    females age 13-19 in all California counties is 1,932,377, 10% of which is 193,378.

                                    The unadjusted teen birth rate is simply the number of births to teens, divided by the number of teens, 
                                    multiplied by 1,000. The adjusted teen birth rate is the number of teen births plus one, divided by the 
                                    number of teens plus two, multiplied by 1,000. This adjustment has little effect in large counties, but 
                                    does impact the birth rate in smaller counties. Compare the adjusted and unadjusted teen birth rates in 
                                    rows 9 and 10 to see this.

                                    After the adjusted teen birth rate is calculated, the counties are ordered by the adjusted birth rate, 
                                    lowest first, as was done in the table above. The cumulative number of teen females, shown in the 
                                    second to last column, crosses the 10% threshold of 193,378 in the 12th row, where the cumulative 
                                    population is 255,753. These 12 counties are used to calculate the teen birth rate using the 
                                    cumulative totals:
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    3291 / 255753 * 1000 = 12.87.
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    The “ABC” benchmark for teen birth rate is thus 12.87.

                                    Teen mothers are more likely to not graduate from high school and/or pursue postsecondary education, 
                                    experience more rapid repeat pregnancy, face the challenges of single parenting and grapple with 
                                    unemployment and poverty, all of which can result in inadequate support for well-being. Teen Birth 
                                    Rate maps shows the number of births per 1,000 females ages 13-19, averaged over 2009-2011. It also 
                                    compares these rates to a benchmark. This benchmark is based on the teen birth rate experienced by 
                                    10% of all CA females ages 13-19 in the counties with the lowest teen birth rates. Maps by sex and

                                    birth annually, averaged over the years 2009-2011, divided by the number of females in the same age 
                                    group from the 2010 Census, multiplied by 1,000. Analyses by racial/ethnic subgroup use female 
                                    racial/ethnic population data from U.S. Census 2010. Births were geocoded to the mother's home 
                                    address. Births that could not be geocoded were excluded (59,942 out of 1,533,890 births, or 3.9%).

                                    Analyses by racial/ethnic group and sex are calculated only for counties due to very small sub-group

                                    than the federal poverty level. To generate analyses based on the benchmark, data were collected from 
                                    the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey 5-year estimates for 2010, using table B17001 
                                    "Poverty Status in the Past 12 Months by Sex and Age.” Since the American Community Survey (ACS) is not 
                                    a complete census, a margin of error (MOE) for each data point is given with the raw data. In this indicator, 
                                    we combined several estimate to create the poverty level variable. Please beware of census tracts with large

                                    Youth who do not complete high school are more likely to experience a variety of challenges to their 
                                    well-being and less access to support. This indicator measures the rates at which young people ages 
                                    18 to 24 have less than a 9th grade education or entered 9th to 12th grades but received no diploma. 
                                    The map also compares this rate to a benchmark. This benchmark is based on the lowest non-completion 
                                    (or “dropout”) rates experienced by 10% of all CA 18-24 year olds. Data by sex and race/ethnicity are 
                                    available by county and census tract. However…only because the very small numbers in many census 
                                    tracts make analyses unreliable.

                                    This indicator was created by dividing the number individuals who did not complete high school by 
                                    the total population of 18-24 year olds. Data were collected from the U.S. Census Bureau's American

                                    Since the American Community Survey (ACS) is not a complete census, a margin of error (MOE) for each 
                                    data point is given with the raw data. We combined several estimates to create this indicator. Please 
                                    beware of census tracts with large MOEs because the estimates in these tracts are less likely to be 
                                    accurate. Click <a href="#" class="more-link" data-panelid="dropoutInfo">here</a> for more on the MOE calculation.

                                    registered voters for each by county.

                                    We used official registration records from each California county’s Office of the Registrar of 
                                    Voters (compiled and dissaggregated by the Statewide Database). These are actual registration 
                                    records and not representative samples. For more information on SWDB data collection methods,

                                        <p>To qualify as low-income, census tracts must meet the Treasury Department's New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) 
                                            program eligibility criteria. Furthermore, to qualify as a food desert tract, at least 33 percent of the 
                                            tract's population or a minimum of 500 people in the tract must have low access to a supermarket or large 
                                            grocery store.</p> 

                                        <p>The NMTC program defines a low-income census tract as: any census tract where (1) the poverty rate for 
                                            that tract is at least 20 percent, or (2) for tracts not located within a metropolitan area, the median 
                                            family income for the tract does not exceed 80 percent of statewide median family income; or for tracts 
                                            located within a metropolitan area, the median family income for the tract does not exceed 80 percent 
                                            of the greater of statewide median family income or the metropolitan area median family income.</p> 
                                        
                                        <p>Low access to a healthy food retail outlet is defined as more than 1 mile from a supermarket or large
                                            grocery store in urban areas and as more than 10 miles from a supermarket or large grocery store in rural 
                                            areas. The distance to supermarkets and large grocery stores is measured by the distance between the 
                                            geographic center of the 1-km square grid that contains information on the population (number of people 
                                            and other characteristics) and the nearest supermarket or large grocery store. Once the distance to the 
                                            nearest supermarket or large grocery store is calculated for each grid cell, the number of people or 
                                            housing units more than one mile from a supermarket or large grocery store in urban tracts (or 10 miles 
                                            for rural census tracts) is aggregated to the census tract level. (A census tract is considered rural 
                                            if the centroid of that tract is located in an area with a population of less than 2,500, and all other 
                                            tracts are considered urban tracts.) If the number of people in the census tract with low access is at 
                                            least 500 or the percentage of people in the census tract with low access is at least 33 percent, then 
                                            the census tract is considered a food desert.</p> 
                                        
                                        <p>Note: Some census tracts that contain supermarkets or large grocery stores may meet the criteria of a 
                                            food desert if a substantial number or share of people within that census tract is more than 1 mile 
                                            (urban areas) or 10 miles (rural areas) from the nearest supermarket. Also, some residents of food 
                                            desert census tracts may live within 1 or 10 miles of a supermarket; these residents are not counted 
                                            as low access.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>For 140 densely-populated urban census tracts, the tract area is smaller than 1 square kilometer. For 
                                            these tracts, grid-level population or access data are not available; it was assumed that each of these 
                                            tracts was outside of the 1-mile buffer of a supermarket and that everyone in the tract had low access 
                                            to a supermarket or large grocery store.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>Data on population and income come from the 2000 Census of Population and Housing. The 1-km square grid 
                                            data come from the Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center. Census population data, which are 
                                            released at the block group level, are first allocated to blocks and then allocated aerially down 
                                            to the grid level.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>Information on supermarket and large grocery store locations comes from a directory of supermarkets 
                                            and large grocery stores (food stores with at least $2 million in sales that contain all the major 
                                            food departments found in a traditional supermarket). The directory was developed from a list of 
                                            stores authorized to receive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, augmented 
                                            by data from Trade Dimensions TDLinx (a Nielsen company), a proprietary source of individual 
                                            supermarket store listings, both for the year 2006. Details on these data sources can be found 
                                            in the 2009 ERS report, Access to Affordable and Nutritious Food: Measuring and Understanding

                                    In Putting Youth on the Map, we show the percentage of children age 0 through 17 in the census tract that 
                                    live more than 1 mile from a supermarket or large grocery store (urban tracts) or more than 10 miles from 
                                    a supermarket or large grocery store (rural tracts). The total number of children in each grid cell that 
                                    is either 1 mile (urban tracts) or 10 miles (rural tracts) from a supermarket or large grocery store was 
                                    aggregated at the tract level to produce a census tract total. This total was then divided by the total 
                                    number of children age 0-17 within the census tract to produce the percentage of children with low access.
