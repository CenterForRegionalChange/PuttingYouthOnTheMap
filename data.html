                                The YWI offers a snapshot of overall 
youth well-being by looking across indicators of health, education, 
                                positive social relationships, and 
community engagement. We also break down YWI analyses by sex and

                                    The index uses three main data sources: the U.S. Census Bureau, the California Department of Education (CDE), and the California Healthy Kids Survey (CHKS). Each provides presents limitations (potential weaknesses) that are important to understand when using the YWI because they might bias location scores. 
                                    <br>
                                    <h4 class="expand-heading" style="text-indent:50px;" id="1a">1. U.S. Census Bureau</h4>

                                    The U.S. Census Bureau provides 
extensive data on youth and family conditions throughout the United 
States. 
                                    Here we use American Community 
Survey (ACS) 5-year estimates for 2007-2012. Data limitations include: 
                                        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                                            <li>potential under-representation of undocumented immigrant populations,</li>

                                    <div class="collapsable" id="1bbody" style="padding-left:50px;">
                                    The CDE provides data on California 
students and schools. There are several challenges with the data used 
here. 
                                        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                                            <li>Teachers receive limited instruction on administering physical fitness tests, 
                                                which might lead to variability in the testing and results.</li>
                                            <li>The practice of sending 
some students to alternative schools run by county offices of education,
 
                                                enrollment in charter, 
private and virtual schools (some of which enroll out-of-area students),
 
                                                and home schooling

 incarcerated students are not reflected in district-level data. School 
district 
                                                boundary changes 
complicate accurate data mapping.</li>

                                    </div>
                                    <h4 class="expand-heading" id="1c" style="text-indent:50px;">3. CHKS</h4> 
                                    <div class="collapsable" id="1cbody" style="padding-left:50px;">
                                    The <a href="https://chks.wested.org/" target="_blank">CHKS</a>
 was administered by CDE and WestEd to 5th, 7th, 
                                        9th and 11th grade students in 
most California school districts until 2011 (see [website] for more info
 on 
                                        administration)—here we use 9th 
and 11th grade data. CHKS offers rich information about students' 
experiences, 
                                        and it is the only large-scale 
California youth survey that aims to represent well (or “be 
representative” for) 
                                        geographic areas smaller than 
the county. Important dataset limitations to keep in mind are:
                                        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                                            <li>The survey typically is 
not administered at charter schools, alternative or community day 
                                                schools, home school 
programs, private schools, and schools serving incarcerated youth. 
                                                This could bias 
well-being scores. Data are missing altogether for some districts, in 
other 
                                                cases for a grade level,
 and in all cases for youth not attending school;</li>
                                            <li>School district boundary changes complicate accurate data mapping;</li>
                                            <li>Districts do not always

                                                survey developers to 
produce sound (valid and representative) data. To have valid 
                                                and representative data,
 West Ed and CDE set these criteria.

                                                    <li>An appropriate class subject or class period was identified and used; </li>

                                        We are unable to assess whether 
districts met criteria 1-3. We do provide and use CHKS survey 
participation information. 
                                        For each map with CHKS data, an 
asterisk marks districts where CHKS participation rates were less than 
60%. We provide 
                                        District CHKS Participation 
Rates in district pop-up boxes.  More information on student 
participation is available 
                                        in individual district secondary

                                    The YWI uses data on young people’s 
health, education, social relationships, and community involvement. Data
 types were

 on youth well-being, review of other indices of youth well-being, and 
data availability. 
                                    While the YWI covers some core 
elements of well-being, there are many important elements that we were 
unable to include

                                    For each of the four domains—health,

proportion 
                                    of youth in the most positive

converted each 
                                    item to a percentage of the best 
possible score to standardize the measures. Results from correlational 
and principal 
                                    components analyses then informed 
indicator construction. We use a stepwise approach in which indicators 
are equally 
                                    weighted within each of the 4 domain
 scores, and then the domains are equally weighted in the overall index

participation rates in 
                                    some places (described further in

                                        The index lacks key indicators 
of well-being because data were unavailable, or unavailable at an 
appropriate 
                                        geographic unit. For example, it
 does not include robust measures of relationships with parents, peers, 
or 
                                        partners, which numerous studies

information

and sexual identity development. Indicator data for the education domain
 focuses 
                                        heavily on school and not at all
 on development of other critical life skills and knowledge (e.g. 
knowing 
                                        how to navigate systems, manage 
personal finances, etc.). The analysis is also constrained by the lack

                                        for indicators within domains 
due to differing numbers of indicators within a domain. Our main goals 
were 
                                        to equally weight each area, 
consistent with prior research, and to ensure that indicators provided 
the most 
                                        complete possible picture of 
well-being for each area. We used a method called “principal components 
analysis” 
                                        to help avoid significant 
redundancy in indicator grouping and measurement of effects.

                                        As with any index created by 
summing multiple items into a composite measure, the YWI is subject to 
the 
                                        problem of compensatability. In 
brief, this means that a high score in one area may offset a low score 
in 
                                        another, leading to a moderate 
overall score for an individual school district. Another school district
 may 
                                        achieve the same overall score 
through the combination of moderate sub-area scores. These two 
districts, 
                                        though qualitatively different, 
would appear similar on the map given their index scores. Similarly, two
 
                                        districts could achieve the same
 domain score through different combinations of values on the component 
                                        indicators. The compensability 
problem therefore limits the ability of the index to convey how youth 
are 
                                        faring. To help with 
interpretation, in the pop-up boxes associated with each district we 
provide 
                                        information about the 
distribution of sub-scores whenever possible.

                                        Assessing the validity of a 
multidimensional index is difficult because it is unclear what criteria 
to 
                                        use. However, a set of 
California Capital Region-focused qualitative studies of youth 
well-being (n(youth)=16, 
                                        n(adult allies)=59) offered one 
external basis for assessment of a pilot version of the index, and

                                        To generate the YWI and domain

                                    To develop benchmarks for each indicator, we adopted an approach employed in health care 
                                    research called “Achievable Benchmarks of Care,” or “ABC.” The basic idea is to rank order 
                                    all the counties in order of performance on the indicator, and select the 90th percentile 
                                    as the benchmark. This would set the benchmark at the level achieved by the county which 
                                    performs better than 90% of the other counties. However, this approach can give undue 
                                    influence to very small counties, which may not be very representative of the larger 
                                    population. The “ABC” approach limits the influence that small places can have on the 
                                    benchmark. The steps are as follows:
                                    <ol type="1">
                                    <li>First, calculate the performance for each county, adjusting county size to reduce 
                                        the impact of smaller units</li>
                                    <li>rank order the counties by their adjusted performance scores</li>
                                    <li>beginning with the best-performing county, sequentially add county population until 
                                        at least 10% of the total population is included in the sum</li>
                                    <li>calculate the performance for the subset of counties included in the sum by 
                                        aggregating the numerator and denominator counts.</li>
                                    </ol>

                                    The unadjusted teen birth rate is 
simply the number of births to teens, divided by the number of teens, 
                                    multiplied by 1,000. The adjusted 
teen birth rate is the number of teen births plus one, divided by the 
                                    number of teens plus two, multiplied
 by 1,000. This adjustment has little effect in large counties, but 
                                    does impact the birth rate in 
smaller counties. Compare the adjusted and unadjusted teen birth rates 
in 
                                    rows 9 and 10 to see this.
                                    <br><br>
                                    After the adjusted teen birth rate 
is calculated, the counties are ordered by the adjusted birth rate, 
                                    lowest first, as was done in the 
table above. The cumulative number of teen females, shown in the 
                                    second to last column, crosses the 
10% threshold of 193,378 in the 12th row, where the cumulative 
                                    population is 255,753. These 12 
counties are used to calculate the teen birth rate using the 
                                    cumulative totals:
                                    <br><br>
                                    3291 / 255753 * 1000 = 12.87.
                                    <br><br>
                                    The “ABC” benchmark for teen birth rate is thus 12.87.

                                    Teen mothers are more likely to not 
graduate from high school and/or pursue postsecondary education, 
                                    experience more rapid repeat 
pregnancy, face the challenges of single parenting and grapple with 
                                    unemployment and poverty, all of 
which can result in inadequate support for well-being. Teen Birth 
                                    Rate maps shows the number of births
 per 1,000 females ages 13-19, averaged over 2009-2011. It also 
                                    compares these rates to a benchmark.
 This benchmark is based on the teen birth rate experienced by 
                                    10% of all CA females ages 13-19 in 
the counties with the lowest teen birth rates. Maps by sex and 
                                    race/ethnicity are available by 
county only because the very small numbers of births in many census 
                                    tracts make analyses unreliable.
                                    </p>
                                    <strong>How did we calculate the teen birth rate?</strong>
                                    <p>
                                    This teen birth rate map represents the number of 15 to 19 year olds in each area who gave birth during the years 2009-2011, divided by the total number of females in the same age group over the same time period, multiplied by 1,000. Population totals are U.S. Census population estimates for intercensal years. </p>
<p>
If a mother’s age or race/ethnic group was not specified, the record was dropped. For the county-level analysis, if the mother’s race was listed as “other,” the record was dropped. We used mother’s county of residence as specified in the birth records to calculate the number of births per county. For CCDs, we used mother’s residential address, geocoded to the census tract, to count the number of births to teen mothers in all census tracts within each CCD. Births that could not be geocoded were excluded (6,133 out of 128,756 births to 15 to 19 year olds, or 4.8%). </p>
<p>
The potential for error in the estimated teen birth rate for each location depends primarily on the number of teen births. The number of teen births is expected to follow a Poisson distribution, which expresses the probability that a given number of events will occur within a fixed interval of time and space. Because there is some random temporal and spatial variability in births, the estimated birth rate may vary across geographic units or years, even when the underlying average rate is the same. A statistical measure called margin of error accounts for this naturally occurring variability, and expresses the degree of uncertainty that an estimate is close to the true value. When the margin of error is large relative to the estimate, the estimate is less reliable and should be interpreted with caution. We denote places where the margin of error is 35% the size of the estimate or larger with an asterisk. For a Poisson variable, the margin of error is equal to one divided by the square root of the number of events, multiplied by 1.645. When the number of teen births is 23 or higher, the relative margin of error falls below 35%. Therefore, the estimated birth rate in places with fewer than 23 teen births is considered unreliable and should be used with caution as the true value may differ. </p>
<p>
For the purposes of estimating reliability, we assume that the population denominators have no error. “While this assumption is technically correct only for denominators based on the census that occurs every 10 years, the error in intercensal population estimates is usually small, difficult to measure, and therefore not considered.” (National Vital Statistics Reports, Vol. 51, No. 12, August 4, 2003, page 90 <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr51/nvsr51_12.pdf"> http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr51/nvsr51_12.pdf).</a> </p>
<p>
It should be noted that population estimates for areas or groups with small populations are likely to have more variability, and teen birth estimates in these places should be used with considerable caution.

                                    <strong>Where did we get the data?</strong>
                                    <p>
                                   Teen birth data were obtained (after receiving approval from the Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects) from the California Department of Public Health's Health Information and Research Section, using the Birth Statistical Master Files for 2009-11. County-level female population data came from the U.S. Census postcensal (2009) and intercensal (2010 and 2011) population estimates. Postcensal population estimates are produced by updating the resident population enumerated in a decennial census with estimates of population change (births, deaths, migration) in the years before the next decennial census. Intercensal estimates update the postcensal estimates with information from the next decennial census. We added the population estimates for 2009, 2010, and 2011 to get an estimate of the total number of females ages 15-19 for the race/ethnic groups of interest in each county. Intercensal population estimates are not available for sub-county regions, so we used data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey, table B11001, 5-year estimates for 2011 to get numerator data for the CCD-level teen birth rate indicator. We multiplied the ACS estimate by three to obtain an estimate of the total number of females ages 15 to 19 in in each CCD over the years 2009 to 2011.

                                   Youth who enter the foster care system tend to be vulnerable to inadequate support, which can lead to poor educational, mental and physical health, social developmental and economic outcomes. This map shows foster care entry rates per 1,000 youth age 0 to 17, for the years 2009-11.  The map also compares this rate to a benchmark. This benchmark is based on the foster care entry rates experienced 10% of all CA 0-17 year olds in the counties with the lowest rates in 2009-11. Maps and data are available by county only.

                                    Foster care entry rates are the number of 0 to 17 year olds in each county who entered foster care between 2009 and 2011, divided by the number of 0-17 year olds in 2009-11, multiplied by 1,000. Foster care data could not be reliably geo-located to sub-county regions, so foster care data are not presented for CCDs.
</p><p>
The potential for unreliability in the foster care entry rate was assessed based on the number of foster care entries. The number of entries is expected to follow a Poisson distribution, which expresses the probability that a given number of events will occur within a fixed interval of time and space. Because there is some random temporal and spatial variability in events, the estimated foster care entry rate may vary across geographic units or years, even when the underlying average rate is the same. A statistical measure called margin of error accounts for this naturally occurring variability, and expresses the degree of uncertainty that an estimate is close to the true value.

When the number of foster care entries is 23 or higher, the relative margin of error falls below 35%. Therefore, the estimated foster care entry rate in counties with fewer than 23 foster care entries is considered unreliable and should be used with caution as the true value may differ. </p>

                                    In this map we show the percentage of 0 to 17 year olds living in families with incomes that are below the federal poverty level. To generate analyses based 

on the benchmark, data were collected from the U.S. Census Bureau's American 

Community Survey 5-year estimates for 2011, using Table B17001 "Poverty 

Status in the Past 12 Months by Sex and Age.” Since the American Community 

Survey (ACS) is not a complete census, a margin of error (MOE) for each data 

point is given with the raw data. The margin of error is a statistical measure that 

represents the degree of uncertainty that a given estimate is close to the true 

value being estimated. When the margin of error is large relative to the estimate, 

the estimate is less likely to be close to the true value being estimated. We denote

                                    YYouth who do not complete high school are more likely to experience a variety of challenges to their well-being and less access to support. This indicator measures the rates at which young people ages 18 to 24 have less than a 9th grade education or entered 9th to 12th grades but received no diploma. The map also compares this rate to a benchmark. This benchmark is based on the lowest non-completion (or “dropout”) rates experienced by 10% of all CA 18-24 year olds. Data by sex and race/ethnicity are available for counties and by CCD.</p><p>
The maps are based on estimates that are subject to uncertainty based on small population sizes or rare events. In places where estimates do not meet a certain threshold of reliability (explained below), we display an asterisk and urge you to interpret these estimates with caution as they are less likely to be accurate. 

                                    </p>
                                    <strong>How did we calculate the high school non-completion (dropout) rate?</strong>
                                    <p>
                                    This indicator was created by dividing the number individuals who did not complete high school by the total population of 18-24 year olds. Data were collected from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey 5-year estimates for 2007-11, using Table B15001, "Sex by Age by Educational Attainment for the Population 18 years and Over." 
</p><p>
Since the American Community Survey (ACS) is not a complete census, a margin of error (MOE) for each data point is given with the raw data. The margin of error is a statistical measure that represents the degree of uncertainty that a given estimate is close to the true value being estimated. When the margin of error is large relative to the estimate, the estimate is less likely to be close to the true value being estimated. We denote places where the margin of error is 35% the size of the estimate or larger with an asterisk. <em>Please beware of large MOEs because estimates in these places are less likely to be accurate and should be interpreted with caution.</em>

                                    The percent of California registered
 voters who were youth in the 2010 general election is calculated 
                                    by dividing the number of registered
  voters age 18-23 in that election by the total number of 
                                    registered voters for each by 
county.

                                    We used official registration 
records from each California county’s Office of the Registrar of

<p>
ACS 2006-2010 5-year estimates of 20-24 year olds who were not in school, not employed and not in the labor force were downloaded from the University of Minnesota IPUMS Program* (Integrated Public Use Microdata Series, http://usa.ipums.org/usa/index.shtml) at the PUMA level. A PUMA is a statistical geographical area that contains a census population of at least 100,000. 
In this analysis we used their EMPSTAT variable (which included the above selection criteria) weighted using the PERWT variable (a U.S. population weight used when doing person-level analysis).

CDE calculates suspension/expulsion rates as the number of students who committed one or more Federal Offense Category acts during the academic year and were subsequently suspended or expelled from school divided by the total enrollment. Grounds for suspension or expulsion are defined by California Education Code EC 48900 (see <a href="http://www.gusd.net/cms/lib03/CA01000648/Centricity/Domain/58/EC_%C2%A748900.pdf"> http://www.gusd.net/cms/lib03/CA01000648/Centricity/Domain/58/EC_%C2%A748900.pdf</a>). Here we present school data for 2012-2013.  As of the 2012-13 school year, a student who commits multiple offenses that lead to a single suspension are counted only once per suspension, whereas prior to 2011-2012, schools counted the number of offenses committed which likely resulted in students being counted more than once for the same suspension. This map does NOT include suspension/expulsion rates for school programs for incarcerated youth and home schools.

grocery store (see <a href="http:// www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/ocs/resource/healthy-food-financing-initiative-0">http:// www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/ocs/resource/healthy-food-financing-initiative-0).</a> Our 

food access maps show the percentage and number of children ages 0 to 17 who have low access to grocery 

stores. Low access is defined as living more than 1/2 mile from a supermarket or large grocery 

store in urban tracts, and more than 10 miles from a supermarket or large grocery store in rural tracts. Low-
income tracts are marked with a triangle.

                                        To qualify as low-income, census tracts must meet the Treasury Department's

New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) program eligibility criteria. Furthermore, to 

qualify as a food desert tract, at least 33 percent of the tract's population or a 

minimum of 500 people in the tract must have low access to a supermarket or 

large grocery store. </p><p>

The NMTC program defines a low-income census tract as: any census tract 

where (1) the poverty rate for that tract is at least 20 percent, or (2) for tracts not 

located within a metropolitan area, the median family income for the tract does 

not exceed 80 percent of statewide median family income; or for tracts located 

within a metropolitan area, the median family income for the tract does not 

exceed 80 percent of the greater of statewide median family income or the 

metropolitan area median family income. </p><p>

Low access to a healthy food retail outlet is defined as living more than 1/2 mile 

from a supermarket or large grocery store in urban areas and as more than 10 

miles from a supermarket or large grocery store in rural areas. The distance to 

supermarkets and large grocery stores is measured by the distance between the 

geographic center of the 1-km square grid that contains information on the 

population (number of people and other characteristics) and the nearest 

supermarket or large grocery store. Once the distance to the nearest 

supermarket or large grocery store is calculated for each grid cell, the number of 

people or housing units more than 1/2 mile from a supermarket or large grocery 

store in urban tracts (or 10 miles for rural census tracts) is aggregated to the 

census tract level. (A census tract is considered rural if the centroid of that tract 

is located in an area with a population of less than 2,500, and all other tracts are 

considered urban tracts.) If the number of people in the census tract with low 

access is at least 500 or the percentage of people in the census tract with low 

access is at least 33 percent, then the census tract is considered a food desert. 

Note: Some census tracts that contain supermarkets or large grocery stores may 

meet the criteria of a food desert if a substantial number or share of people 

within that census tract is more than 1/2 mile (urban areas) or 10 miles (rural 

areas) from the nearest supermarket. Also, some residents of food desert 

census tracts may live within 1/2 or 10 miles of a supermarket; these residents 

are not counted as low access. </p><p>

For 140 densely-populated urban census tracts, the tract area is smaller than 1 

square kilometer. For these tracts, grid-level population or access data are not 

available; it was assumed that each of these tracts was outside of the 1-mile 

buffer of a supermarket and that everyone in the tract had low access to a 

supermarket or large grocery store. </p><p>

Data on population and income come from the 2000 Census of Population and 

Housing. The 1-km square grid data come from the Socioeconomic Data and 

Applications Center. Census population data, which are released at the block 

group level, are first allocated to blocks and then allocated aerially down to the 

grid level. </p><p>

Information on supermarket and large grocery store locations comes from a 

directory of supermarkets and large grocery stores (food stores with at least $2 

million in sales that contain all the major food departments found in a traditional 

supermarket). The directory was developed from a list of stores authorized to 

receive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, augmented 

by data from Trade Dimensions TDLinx (a Nielsen company), a proprietary 

source of individual supermarket store listings, both for the year 2006. Details on 

these data sources can be found in the 2009 ERS report, Access to Affordable 

and Nutritious Food: Measuring and Understanding Food Deserts and Their 

Consequences.</p>

<h3 style="padding-top: 175px;">Equity Analyses</h3>

<p>The Youth Well-Being Index (YWI) and Youth Vulnerability Index (YVI) maps show index scores and indicator rates by sex and race/ethnicity for specific places. This page provides statewide analyses of the YWI and YVI. For the YWI we provide analyses by sex, race/ethnicity and community type (e.g. rural, suburban, urban). For the YVI we provide analyses by sex and race/ethnicity. These analyses use the same data and calculations as the maps; for more information about them please see the <a href="#metadata" alt="go to metadata">Metadata</a> page.</p>

<a > <h4 class="equityC" id="one">Youth Well-Being Index (YWI) Statewide Sub-Group Analyses</h4></a>

<p id="oneE">The YWI presents a holistic measure of youth well-being based on an optimal score of 100%. The YWI includes measures for four “domains:” education, health, social relationships and community involvement.</p>


<h4 class="equity" id="two"> &nbsp; &ndash; YWI By Sex</h4>

<p id="twoE">Available data allow us to calculate the YWI using the categories “male” and “female.”  The chart below shows that females score slightly higher than males on the YWI overall. While females and males have the same score for the “Community Context” dimension, which looks at local household incomes and civic participation, females have higher scores in Health, Social Relationships, and especially Education. Males and females both have the highest scores in Social Relationships and the lowest in Education.

<h4 class="equity" id="three"> &nbsp; &ndash; YWI By Race/Ethnicity</h4>
<div id="threeE">
<p>Calculating the YWI by race/ethnicity is challenging because different data sources that make up the index use varying racial/ethnic categories. We did the best we could to specify groups, although are still unable to differentiate between many meaningful racial/ethnic categories (for example, breaking out all national/ethnic groups within the “Asian” and “Black” categories, breaking out racial and ethnic groups in the “Hispanic” category, knowing who makes up the group that identified with “two or more” racial/ethnic groups).</p> 

<p>The chart below shows statewide YWI scores for each racial/ethnic category. The YWI score for all of California is shown at the far right.</p>

<h4 class="equity" id="eleven"> &nbsp; &ndash; YWI By Community/District Type</h4>

<p id="elevenE">This chart shows the mean YWI scores for each community/district type. The mean score for all districts, 63% out of a potential 100%, is on the right. This comparison shows that youth well-being scores are somewhat higher than the state mean in small cities and large suburbs, while they are somewhat lower in distant towns.<br>

</p>

<h4 class="equity" id="six"> &nbsp; &ndash; YWI “Domains” By Community/District Type</h4>
<div id="sixE">
<p>The Youth Well-Being Index includes 4 elements or “domains” of well-being: health, education, social relationships, and community involvement (see more on this on the “Data” page). The charts below show the mean scores in each of these domains by community/district type.</p>

<p><em>Health (including measures of physical fitness, substance use avoidance and feeling safe)</em><br>
Statewide the mean Health score is 64% out of a possible 100%. Remote rural localities (58%), distant rural areas (61%), and remote towns (61%) stand out as having somewhat lower scores. In contrast, small cities (66%), large suburbs (66%), mid-size cities (65%) and mid-size suburbs (65%) have higher scores.</p>

<img src="images/data/image008.png" alt="Health Domain by Locale Type" width="700">


<p><em>Education (including measures of high school completion and college readiness)</em><br>
Statewide the mean Education score is 58% out of a possible 100%. Distant towns (55%) and remote rural areas (56%) have somewhat lower mean scores, while small cities (64%) and large suburbs (63%) have higher mean scores.</p>

<img src="images/data/image009.png" alt="Education Domain by Locale Type" width="700">

<p><em>Social Relationships (including measures of having positive relationships with school peers and adults in and out of school)</em><br>
Statewide the mean Social Relationships score is 68% out of a possible 100%. Large cities (66%) and mid-size cities (67%) and distant towns (67%) have somewhat lower scores, while remote towns (70%), and distant (69%) and remote rural (69%) communities have the highest scores.</p>

<img src="images/data/image010.png" alt="Social Domain by Locale Type" width="700">


<p><em>Community Involvement (including measures of youth civic and activity participation)</em><br>
Statewide the mean Community Involvement score is 63% out of a possible 100%. Populations in remote rural areas (67%), remote towns (67%) and large suburbs (66%) have the highest mean scores, while large cities (61%) and distant towns (62%) have the lowest.</p>

<h4 class="equityC" id="seven">Youth Vulnerability Index (YVI) Statewide Sub-Group Analyses (2009-2011)</h4>
<div id="sevenE">
<p>The YVI assesses potential for isolation from adequate support for well-being, combining four indicators: the rates at which youth became teen mothers, did not complete high school, were placed in foster care, and lived in households with very low incomes. In each place indicators are ranked on a scale of 1-4:</p>
<ol id="dec">
    <li>met benchmark (lowest average county rate experienced by 10% of the target CA youth population in 2010)</li>
    <li>nearing the benchmark (within 90%)</li>
    <li>below the benchmark (within 50%-90%)</li>
    <li>far below the benchmark (below 50% on benchmark).</li>
</ol>
<p>The YVI is the average of these four scores in a given location. Counties with a very low YVI score (1 or close to 1) have low rates across all indicators, and therefore lower levels of vulnerability. Counties with a very high YVI scores (4 or close to 4) have high rates across all indicators, and therefore relatively high levels of vulnerability.</p>

<p>The YVI maps show YVI scores and related indicator data by county for all youth and for specific sub-groups. But what do YVI scores and indicator data look like by sub-group in the state as a whole? Here we share some analyses in chart form for females, males, and six racial/ethnic categories: White, Asian, Black, Hispanic/Latino, American Indian/Native Alaskan, and Two or More(*1).</p>

<p>For more information on the data sources please see the “Data” section of this website. Consider doing your own research and/or using other research to add to analyses we offer here.</p>

<p>(*1) These analyses employ statewide datasets for each population. They do not reflect averages across counties.</p>
</div>


<h4 class="equity" id="eight"> &nbsp; &ndash; YVI By Male/Female Sub-Groups</h4>
<div id="eightE">
<p>Available data allow us to calculate the YVI using the categories “male” and “female.” The chart below shows that statewide females scored slightly higher than males on the YVI overall. However, there were some differences across individual indicators.</p>

<img src="images/data/image012.png" alt="YVI by Sex" width="700">


<p><em>Foster Care Entry (number of children and youth ages 0-17 per 1000, 2009-2011)</em><br>
Females entered foster care at slightly higher rates than males (3.46 females per 1000 versus 3.19 males per 1000).</p>

<img src="images/data/image013.png" alt="Foster Care Entry by Sex" width="700">


<p><em>High School Non-Completion (number of youth ages 20-24 per 100)</em><br>
Among young males ages 20 to 24, 21.06 per 100 did not complete high school, in comparison with 14.66 per 100 young women.</p>

<img src="images/data/image014.png" alt="High School Non-Completion by Sex" width="700">

<p><em>Very Low Family Income (number of youth ages 12 to 17 per 100)</em><br>
Females lived in families with incomes below the federal poverty line at almost the same rates than males (19.19 females ages 0-17 per 1000 versus 18.93 males ages 0-17 per 1000).</p>

<img src="images/data/image015.png" alt="Poverty by Sex" width="700">


<p><em>Teen Birth Rates (number of births to females ages 15-19 per 1000)</em><br>
Unfortunately there are no data available on births to teen fathers, so we report here only on births to teen mothers. Statewide from 2009-2011, 30.22 females ages 15-19 per 1000 gave birth.</p>
</div>
<h4 class="equity" id="nine"> &nbsp; &ndash; YVI By Race/Ethnicity</h4>
<div id="nineE">
<p>Calculating the YVI by race/ethnicity is challenging because different data sources that make up the index use varying racial/ethnic categories. We used categories that could be applied across all data sets. Unfortunately these categories do not differentiate between many meaningful racial/ethnic categories (for example, breaking out all national/ethnic groups within the “Asian” and “Black” categories, breaking out racial and ethnic groups in the “Hispanic” category, knowing who makes up the group that identified with “two or more” racial/ethnic groups).  The chart below shows statewide YVI scores for each racial/ethnic category (AIAN stands for “American Indian/Alaskan Native). The YVI score for all of California is shown at the far right.</p>

<img src="images/data/image016.png" alt="YVI by Race/Ethnicity" width="700">

<p>This chart shows that statewide young people identified as Black and young people identified as American Indian/Alaskan Native are experiencing at high rates all four conditions associated with isolation from support for well-being. Young people identified as Hispanic/Latino or identified with two or more racial/ethnic categories are also experiencing most of these conditions at high rates. White youth experience these conditions at the lowest rates in the state.</p>
</div>


<h4 class="equity" id="ten"> &nbsp; &ndash; YVI Indicators By Race/Ethnicity</h4>
<div id="tenE">
<p>The Youth Vulnerability Index includes 4 indicators of isolation from adequate support for well-being: the rates at which young people were placed in foster care, did not complete high school, lived in households with very low incomes, and became teen mothers. (see more on this on the “About Data” page). The charts below show the actual statewide rates by race/ethnicity.</p>

<p><em>Foster Care Entry (number of children and youth ages 0-17 per 1000)</em><br>
Statewide children and youth identified as Black and children and youth identified as Native American/Alaskan Native entered foster care at the highest rates from 2009-2011. Children identified as Asian entered foster care at the lowest rates.</p>

<img src="images/data/image017.png" alt="Foster Care Entry by Race/Ethnicity" width="700">


<p><em>High School Non-Completion (number of youth ages 20-24 per 100)</em><br>
Statewide just over 28 of every 100 young people identified as Hispanic had not completed high school at the highest rates. American Indian/Alaskan Native and Black youth had also not completed high school at high rates. Asian and White youth were least likely to have not completed high school.</p>

<img src="images/data/image018.png" alt="High School Non-Completion by Race/Ethnicity" width="700">


<p><em>Very Low Family Income (number of youth ages 12 to 17 per 100)</em><br>
Statewide the families of more than 25 of every 100 young people identified as Black, Hispanic or American Indian/Alaskan Native earned less than the federal poverty line. The families of approximately 8 of every 100 young people identified as White experienced these economic circumstances.</p>

<img src="images/data/image019.png" alt="Poverty by Race/Ethnicity" width="700">

<p><em>Teen Birth Rates (number of births to females ages 15-19 per 1000)</em><br>
Statewide female teens identified as Hispanic had the highest birth rates from 2009-2011, followed by Black and American Indian/Alaskan Native female teens. Young women identified as Asian had the lowest birth rates.</p>
