        This page has detailed information about all Putting Youth on the Map indices, data sources, 
        and potential data and map shortcomings "limitations"). Soon you will be able to download the 
        data used in making these maps. Click on the map series of interest for this information.
        
        <h1>Youth Well-Being Index (YWI)</h1>

        The YWI offers a snapshot of overall youth well-being by looking across indicators of health, education, 
        positive social relationships, and community engagement. We also break down YWI analyses by sex and race/ethnicity.
        <br />
        
        <img src="img/YWI_overview.png" alt="Youth Wellbeing Index graphical representation"/>
        <br/>
        
        We selected YWI indicators based on a review of research and other indices, as well as data availability for 
        geographic units smaller than counties. For more information about the YWI, click the sections below. 

        <h2 class="expand-heading">I. CAUTION: YWI Data Sources and their Limitations</h2>
        <div class="collapsable">
            The index uses three main data sources: the U.S. Census Bureau, the California Department of Education (CDE), 
            and the California Healthy Kids Survey (CHKS). Each provides presents limitations (potential weaknesses) 
            that are important to understand when using the YWI because they might bias location scores. 
            <br/>
            <h4 class="expand-heading">1. U.S. Census Bureau</h4> 
            <div class="collapsable">
            The U.S. Census Bureau provides extensive data on youth and family conditions throughout the United States. 
            Here we use American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year estimates for 2007-2012. Data limitations include: 
                <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                    <li>potential under-representation of undocumented immigrant populations,</li>
                    <li>increased potential for population estimate errors for low-density rural areas.</li>
                </ul> 
            </div>
            <h4 class="expand-heading">2. CDE</h4> 
            <div class="collapsable">
            The CDE provides data on California students and schools. There are several challenges with the data used here. 
                <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                    <li>Teachers receive limited instruction on administering physical fitness tests, 
                        which might lead to variability in the testing and results.</li>
                    <li>The practice of sending some students to alternative schools run by county offices of education, 
                        enrollment in charter, private and virtual schools (some of which enroll out-of-area students), 
                        and home schooling affect the accuracy of dropout rates for district geographic areas; these schools’ 
                        data, along with that of incarcerated students are not reflected in district-level data. School district 
                        boundary changes complicate accurate data mapping.</li>
                </ul> 
            </div>
            <h4 class="expand-heading">3. CHKS</h4> 
            <div class="collapsable">
            The <a href="https://chks.wested.org" target="_blank">CHKS</a> was administered by CDE and WestEd to 5th, 7th, 
                9th and 11th grade students in most California school districts until 2011 (see [website] for more info on 
                administration)—here we use 9th and 11th grade data. CHKS offers rich information about students' experiences, 
                and it is the only large-scale California youth survey that aims to represent well (or “be representative” for) 
                geographic areas smaller than the county. Important dataset limitations to keep in mind are:
                <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                    <li>The survey typically is not administered at charter schools, alternative or community day 
                        schools, home school programs, private schools, and schools serving incarcerated youth. 
                        This could bias well-being scores. Data are missing altogether for some districts, in other 
                        cases for a grade level, and in all cases for youth not attending school;</li>
                    <li>School district boundary changes complicate accurate data mapping;</li>
                    <li>Districts do not always meet the sampling and participation guidelines set by the 
                        survey developers to produce sound (valid and representative) data. To have valid 
                        and representative data, West Ed and CDE set these criteria.
                        <ol style="list-style-type: 1; font-size: 0.8em; margin-top: 3px;">
                            <li>100% of all district schools participated; or 100% of all selected schools participated in an approved sampling plan;</li>
                            <li>An appropriate class subject or class period was identified and used; </li>
                            <li>100% of selected classrooms participated; </li>
                            <li>The number of usable answer forms received was 60% or more of the selected sample [at least 70% is considered optimal].</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ul> 
                We are unable to assess whether districts met criteria 1-3. We do provide and use CHKS survey participation information. 
                For each map with CHKS data, an asterisk marks districts where CHKS participation rates were less than 60%. We provide 
                District CHKS Participation Rates in district pop-up boxes.  More information on student participation is available 
                in individual district secondary level reports, available at <a href="http://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/" target="_blank">http://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/</a>
                [Use “district” as the “level,” and “California Healthy Kids Survey” as the “subject.” Within the report see “Sample Characteristic” tables.]
                <br/><br/>
                CHKS participation rates affect YWI map and data availability in two important ways:
                <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                    <li>We do not calculate the YWI Score for districts where CHKS participation rates were less than 40% and/or 
                        fewer than 15 participants answered the survey questions we used. However, underlying indicator data are 
                        provided for these districts.</li>
                    <li>The YWI and underlying CHKS indicator data are provided by racial/ethnic group only where the district 
                        participation rate is at least 40% and at least 15 participants of specific racial/ethnic backgrounds 
                        have answered the survey questions used.</li>
                </ul> 
            </div>
            <strong>All data source limitations should be considered when interpreting the indicator data and using this index.</strong>
        </div>

        <h2 class="expand-heading">II. YWI Data</h2>
        <div class="collapsable">
            The YWI assesses adolescent outcomes across four domains: health, education, social relationships, and community context. 
            Each domain is comprised of one to three indicators, and each indicator includes one or more measures, as described below. 
            Domains, indicators and measures were selected based on review of research on youth well-being and review of other 
            indices of youth well-being (Erbstein, Hartzog and Geraghty, forthcoming).

        <h2 class="expand-heading">III. YWI Construction</h2>
        <div class="collapsable">
            For each of the four domains—health, education, social relationships, and community context—we construct analyses of the 
            proportion of youth that fall into the most positive category across indicators. The index presents a composite score
            based on all four domains. 
            <br /><br />
            Original data elements came in multiple forms (e.g. Likert scales of varying size, percentages). Each item was converted 
            to a percentage of the best possible score. Once the measures were standardized, results from correlational and principal 
            components analyses were used to construct indicators. We then use a stepwise approach in which indicators are equally 
            weighted in each domain score, and then the domains are equally weighted in the overall index score.
            <br /><br />
            Like any index, the YWI presents multiple limitations that should be considered in interpreting results.
            <br /><br />
            <i>Indicators</i>
            <br />
            The index lacks key indicators of well-being because data were unavailable, or unavailable at an appropriate scale. 
            For example, it does not include robust measures of relationships with parents, peers, or partners, which numerous 
            studies find are pivotal factors in youth well-being. Nor does it include information about positive gender, ethnic 
            and sexual identity development. Indicator data for the education domain focuses heavily on school and not at all 
            on development of other critical life skills and knowledge (e.g. knowing how to navigate systems, manage personal 
            finances, etc.).  The analysis is also constrained by the lack of data on positive indicators of youth well-being 
            (as opposed to measures of negative behaviors and outcomes).
            <br /><br />
            <i>Weighting</i>
            <br />
            Indices are sensitive to the items included, how they are grouped, and how they are weighted in calculations of 
            summary scores. The 'stepwise equal weighting' method used here ultimately does create unequal weights for 
            indicators within domains due to differing numbers of indicators within a domain. Our primary goals were to 
            equally weight domains, consistent with prior research, and to ensure that indicators provided the most complete 
            possible picture of well-being for each domain. Use of principal components analysis helped avoid significant 
            redundancy in the grouping of indicators and measurement of effects.
            <br /><br />
            <i>Compensatability</i>
            <br />
            As with any index created by summing multiple items into a composite measure, the YWI is subject to the problem 
            of compensatability. A high score in one domain may offset a low score in another domain, leading to a moderate 
            overall score for a school district. Another school district may achieve the same overall score through the 
            combination of moderate sub-domain scores. These two districts, though qualitatively different, would appear 
            similar on the map given their index scores. Similarly, two districts could achieve the same domain score through 
            different combinations of values on the component indicators. The compensability problem therefore limits the 
            ability of the index to convey how youth are faring. To offset this, we provide information about the distribution 
            of domain scores, and when possible, indicator scores. 
            <br /><br />
            <i>Significance</i> 
            <br />
            We are unable to test statistical significance between well-being scores by school districts. Since data were
            collected at the school district level (one observation per variable per school district) at a single point in time, 
            we are unable to assess the stability of our estimates or the error in each observation.
            <br /><br />
            <i>Validity</i>
            <br />
            Assessing the validity of a multidimensional index is difficult because it is unclear what criteria to use. However, 
            a set of Capital Region-focused qualitative studies of youth well-being (n(youth)=16, n(adult allies)=59) offered one 
            external basis for assessment of a pilot version of the index, and patterns captured in that version did reflect 
            local and regional qualitative descriptions. Going forward, it will be important to compare this index to others, 
            assess its ability to predict various concurrent and future outcomes, and assess its utility as a tool for 
            policy-makers, youth-focused practitioners and youth advocates. 
            <br /><br />
            <strong>All index construction limitations should be considered when using this index.</strong> Despite these limitations, the 
            index captures many key aspects of youth well-being, including factors known to predict successful and healthy 
            transitions to adulthood and factors that youth consider important. An index based on all of these indicators 
            provides a snapshot of the state of California's youth.

        <h2 class="expand-heading">IV. YWI Mapping</h2>
        <div class="collapsable">
            Index data were imported into GIS software (ArcMap v10.0, Esri, Redlands, CA) and joined to a geographic file 
            representing merged Unified School District boundaries and Secondary School District boundaries (original boundary

            For each of the four domains 
            and the aggregate index, a map representing the distribution of the data was symbolized. In each map, data are 
            broken down into 10% intervals that range from a low of 20% to the maximum possible score, 100%.
            <br /><br />
            The school district scale may still mask important intra-district geographic disparities. Please see the Tutorial 
            section of this website for information on interpretation of spatial data.

        <h1>Index of Youth Vulnerability</h1>

        The index of youth vulnerability combines four indicators that have been associated with youth marginalization 
        from many of the institutional settings that facilitate pathways to a healthy adulthood for most youth. They 
        include: teen parenting, not completing high school, foster care placement and low family income. Though we 
        originally intended to include involvement in the juvenile justice system (felony arrests) as a fifth indicator, 
        those data were unavailable to us. For each indicator used, we normalized the data and then categorized into 
        quintiles. Each quintile was then given a rank from 1 to 5 with 1 representing lowest levels of vulnerability 
        or need and 5 indicating the highest levels. Please see the metadata for each of the indicators for specific 
        information on data manipulation and analysis. To create the final index, we averaged the rank for each of 
        the four predictive indicators. Then the results were classified by quintiles such that the lowest quintile 
        would represent areas with the least vulnerability to disconnection while the highest quintile would be at 
        risk for disconnection.

        <h2 class="expand-heading">Teen Birth Rate</h2>
        <div class="collapsable">
            Teen mothers are more likely to not graduate from high school and/or pursue postsecondary education, 
            experience more rapid repeat pregnancy, face the challenges of single parenthood and grapple with 
            unemployment and poverty.  This teen birth rate map represents the number of 13 to 19 year olds in each 
            census tract who gave birth in 2010 divided by number of females in the same age group. Teen birth data 
            were obtained (after receiving approval from the Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects) from 
            the California Department of Public Health's Health Information and Research Section, using the Birth 
            Statistical Master File for 2010. A total of 43,651 births were known to occur to mothers under the age 
            of 20. Births were geocoded to the mother's home address. Seventy-eight teen mothers did not have 
            addresses in the database (0.18%) and another 99 (0.23%) could not be geocoded due to improper address 
            information. The remaining addresses with a successful geocode were aggregated to the census tract 
            level and then divided by the female population age 13-19 (the at risk population) to achieve a teen 
            birth rate. Female population data came from the U.S. Census report QT-P2 (Single Years of Age and Sex) 
            from the 2010 Census Summary File 1.

        <h2 class="expand-heading">Foster Care Entry Rate</h2>
        <div class="collapsable">
            Youth who enter into the foster care system tend to be vulnerable to inadequate support that leads to 
            poor educational, mental and physical health, social developmental and economic outcomes. Our map shows 
            the rate of foster care entry per 1,000 youth age 0 to 17 in 2010. The raw foster care data were collected 
            from the Child Welfare Dynamic Reporting System which is a California Department of Social Services / 
            University of California at Berkeley collaboration. Their website is:
            <a href="http://cssr.berkeley.edu/ucb_childwelfare/GeoData.aspx" target="_blank">http://cssr.berkeley.edu/ucb_childwelfare/GeoData.aspx</a>. 
            Of note, the foster care data for 2010 were collected based on year 2000 census tracts. In order to 
            crosswalk the 2000 census tract data to 2010 boundaries, we used code developed for STATA statistical 
            software (Stata/MP 12.0 for Windows, StataCorp LP, College Station, TX) by researchers at Brown University*. 
            The code can be accessed at:

            The use agreement for this code included non-redistribution of the data. For that reason, we only allow 
            download of the foster care entry rate rank.

        <h2 class="expand-heading">Poverty Rate</h2>
        <div class="collapsable">
            Lower family income is associated with decreased opportunities for transition to a healthy adulthood. 
            In this map we show the poverty rate as the percentage of 12 to 17 year olds living in families with 
            incomes that are less than 200% of the federal poverty level. Data were collected from the U.S. Census 
            Bureau's American Community Survey 5-year estimates for 2010, using table B17024 "Age by ratio of income 
            to poverty level in the past 12 months." Since the American Community Survey (ACS) is not a complete 
            census, a margin of error (MOE) for each data point is given with the raw data. In this indicator, we 
            combined several estimate to create the &lt; 200% poverty level variable. An explanation of the margin of 
            error calculation for aggregated count data and derived proportions is shown below. Please beware of 
            census tracts with large MOEs because the data are likely much less accurate.

            <i>Variable list in the ACS report (see below). Note that the number ranges indicate the ratio of 
            income to poverty level in the past 12 months. Therefore, to obtain &lt; 200% poverty level, one could 
            add all of the populations under 2_00…OR…add all of the populations 2_00 and above and subtract them 
            from the total. When working with the margins of error, it is generally considered best practice to use 
            the fewest number of variables or components possible to reduce error.</i>

        <h2 class="expand-heading">High School Dropout Rate</h2>
        <div class="collapsable">
            Youth who do not complete high school are more likely to experience a variety of challenges, including poverty, 
            poor physical and mental health, and more limited opportunity, among others. High School Dropout was defined as 
            adults ages 18 to 24 who had less than a 9th grade education or who entered 9th to 12th grades but received no 
            diploma. The dropout rate was created by taking those individuals divided by the total population of 18-24 year 
            olds. Data were collected from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey 5-year estimates for 2010, 
            using Table B15001, "Sex by Age by Educational Attainment for the Population 18 years and Over." To search 
            the U.S. Census website for data, please see the American Fact Finder query tool at:

            Since the American Community Survey (ACS) is not a complete census, a margin of error (MOE) for each data 
            point is given with the raw data. In this indicator, we combined several estimate to create the High School 
            Dropout indicator. An explanation of the margin of error calculation for aggregated count data and derived 
            proportions is shown below. Please beware of census tracts with large MOEs because the data are likely much 
            less accurate.

        <h1>Other Map Data</h1>
        
        A good map will answer questions about a problem. And typically, a good map will also inspire some new questions and 
        stimulate the map reader to generate new hypotheses. In anticipation of this phenomenon, we have included a number 
        of additional data driven maps to facilitate the process. So in addition to the cumulative index maps for well-being 
        and vulnerability and all of their indicators, we also include youth population demographics, truancy rates, food 
        deserts, assets such as 4-H club density and more. In each case, we’ve mapped data at the smallest possible scale 
        available.

            Young people who are both out of work and out of school often lack access to support for a healthy transition

            downloaded from the University of Minnesota IPUMS Program* (Integrated Public Use Microdata Series) at the 
            PUMA level.  A PUMA is a statistical geographical area that contains a census population of 100,000. 
            Selection criteria included persons who were:  not in school, not employed and not in labor force, and 
            ages 20 to 24. To review the data at its source or collect data for other years, please see the website

            special interest/short-term, military and overnight camp programs. Youth population data 
            were collected from the 2010 decennial census; form SF1, report QT-P1, and 4-H Club data

            We have included the relevant information below – adapted directly from the above website.
            <br /><br />
            The Healthy Food Financing Initiative (HFFI) Working Group defines a food desert as a low-income census 
            tract where a substantial number or share of residents has low access to a supermarket or large grocery 
            store. To qualify as low-income, census tracts must meet the Treasury Department's New Markets Tax Credit 
            (NMTC) program eligibility criteria. Furthermore, to qualify as a food desert tract, at least 33 percent 
            of the tract's population or a minimum of 500 people in the tract must have low access to a supermarket 
            or large grocery store.
            <br /><br />
            The NMTC program defines a low-income census tract as: any census tract where (1) the poverty rate for 
            that tract is at least 20 percent, or (2) for tracts not located within a metropolitan area, the median 
            family income for the tract does not exceed 80 percent of statewide median family income; or for tracts 
            located within a metropolitan area, the median family income for the tract does not exceed 80 percent 
            of the greater of statewide median family income or the metropolitan area median family income.
            <br /><br />
            Low access to a healthy food retail outlet is defined as more than 1 mile from a supermarket or large 
            grocery store in urban areas and as more than 10 miles from a supermarket or large grocery store in rural 
            areas. The distance to supermarkets and large grocery stores is measured by the distance between the 
            geographic center of the 1-km square grid that contains information on the population (number of people 
            and other characteristics) and the nearest supermarket or large grocery store. Once the distance to the 
            nearest supermarket or large grocery store is calculated for each grid cell, the number of people or 
            housing units more than one mile from a supermarket or large grocery store in urban tracts (or 10 miles 
            for rural census tracts) is aggregated to the census tract level. (A census tract is considered rural 
            if the centroid of that tract is located in an area with a population of less than 2,500, and all other 
            tracts are considered urban tracts.) If the aggregate number of people in the census tract with low 
            access is at least 500 or the percentage of people in the census tract with low access is at least 33 
            percent, then the census tract is considered a food desert.
            <br /><br />
            Application of these criteria results in 6,500 census tracts in the continental U.S. that meet the 
            definition of a food desert (food deserts are not yet defined for Alaska and Hawaii). Roughly 75 
            percent of these food-desert tracts are urban, while the remaining 25 percent are rural. An estimated 
            total of 13.5 million people in these census tracts have low access to a supermarket or large grocery 
            store—that is, they live more than 1 or 10 miles from a supermarket or large grocery store. Of these 
            13.5 million people, 82.1 percent are in urban areas.
            <br /><br />
            Note: Some census tracts that contain supermarkets or large grocery stores may meet the criteria of 
            a food desert if a substantial number or share of people within that census tract is more than 1 mile 
            (urban areas) or 10 miles (rural areas) from the nearest supermarket. Furthermore, some residents of 
            food desert census tracts may live within 1 or 10 miles of a supermarket; these residents are not
            counted as low access and thus not counted in the 13.5 million total.
            <br /><br />
            For 140 densely-populated urban census tracts, the tract area is smaller than 1 square kilometer. 
            For these tracts, grid-level population or access data are not available; it was assumed that each 
            of these tracts was outside of the 1-mile buffer of a supermarket and that everyone in the tract 
            had low access to a supermarket or large grocery store.
            <br /><br />
            Data Sources
            <br /><br />
            Data on population and income come from the 2000 Census of Population and Housing. The 1-km square 
            grid data come from the Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center. Census population data, which 
            are released at the block group level, are first allocated to blocks and then allocated aerially 
            down to the grid level.
            <br /><br />
            Information on supermarket and large grocery store locations comes from a directory of supermarkets 
            and large grocery stores (food stores with at least $2 million in sales that contain all the major 
            food departments found in a traditional supermarket). The directory was developed from a list of stores 
            authorized to receive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, augmented by data 
            from Trade Dimensions TDLinx (a Nielsen company), a proprietary source of individual supermarket store 
            listings, both for the year 2006. Details on these data sources can be found in the 2009 ERS report, 
            Access to Affordable and Nutritious Food: Measuring and Understanding Food Deserts and Their Consequences.
            <br /><br />
            In Putting Youth on the Map, we show the percentage of children age 0 through 17 in the census tract 
            that live more than 1 mile from a supermarket or large grocery store (urban tracts) or more than 10 
            miles from a supermarket or large grocery store (rural tracts). The total number of children in each 
            grid cell that is either 1 mile (urban tracts) or 10 miles (rural tracts) from a supermarket or large 
            grocery store was aggregated at the tract level to produce a census tract total. This total was then 
            divided by the total number of children age 0-17 within the census tract to produce the percentage 
            of children with low access.
